  <h1>About Vegan Diet</h1>
  <p>Veganism is both the practice of abstaining from the use of animal products, particularly in diet, and an associated philosophy that
  rejects the commodity status of animals.A follower of either the diet or the philosophy is known as a vegan.
Distinctions are sometimes made between several categories of veganism.</p>
<p> Dietary vegans (or strict vegetarians) refrain from consuming
 animal products, not only meat but also eggs, dairy products and other animal-derived substances. The term ethical vegan is often
 applied to those who not only follow a vegan diet but extend the philosophy into other areas of their lives, and oppose the use of 
 animals for any purpose. Another term is environmental veganism, which refers to the avoidance of animal
 products on the premise that the harvesting or industrial farming of animals is environmentally damaging and unsustainable.</p>

  <h1>Vegan Diet</h1>
  
  <h4>Soy</h4>
  <p>Vegan diets are based on grains and other seeds, legumes (particularly beans), fruits, vegetables, edible mushrooms, and nuts. Meat 
  analogues (mock meats) based on soybeans (tofu), or wheat-based seitan/gluten, 
  are a common source of plant protein, usually in the form of vegetarian sausage, mince, and veggie burgers.</p>
    <h4>Plant milk, cheese, mayo</h4>
  <p>Plant milks—such as soy milk, almond milk, grain milks (oat milk and rice milk), hemp milk, and coconut milk—are used in place of cows'
  or goats' milk.[m] Soy milk provides around 7 g of protein per cup,
  compared with 8 g of protein per cup of cow's milk. Almond milk is lower in dietary energy, carbohydrates and protein.</p>
  <h4>Egg replacements</h4>
  <p>Commercial egg substitutes, such as Bob's Red Mill egg replacer and Ener-G egg replacer, are available for cooking and baking.
  The protein in eggs thickens when heated and binds other ingredients together.
  Flaxseeds will do the same: replace each egg with one tablespoon of flaxseed meal mixed with three tablespoons of water.</p>
