	<div id="flip"><p>What is a vegan?</p></div>
	<div id="panel"><p>Vegans avoid eating all foods of animal origin: meat, fish, dairy products, eggs, and honey.
	Veganism was originally defined purely as a dietary choice, but many vegans extend this ethic to shun animal testing and ingredients from all
	things they consume or wear, including clothing, shoes, personal care items, cosmetics, and medicine.</p></div>
	<br>

	<div id="flip1"><p>Why do people become vegan?</p></div>
	<div id="panel1"><p>The key reasons are explained in our, "Why Choose Vegan?" essay. To summarize, they involve:
	<br> 1) Prevention of Animal Suffering Most farm animals are raised on factory farms and experience appalling cruelties throughout their lives.
	Animal slaughter is invariably gory and disturbing to witness, and often the animals are clearly frightened and seem to know their death is imminent.
	<br> 2) Health Benefits A vegan diet can eliminate many of your diet's most unhealthful foods, replacing them with delicious, nutrient-rich fruits and vegetables,
	whole grains, beans, and nuts. 3) Environmental Advantages Given the staggering amounts of methane produced by livestock,
	a vegan diet may offer the easiest and most effective way to reduce our contribution to climate change.
	Vegan diets can also dramatically reduce the land that must be devoted to crops and to pasture,
	since raising farm animals is extraordinarily wasteful compared to growing crops directly for people.</p></div>

	<div id="flip2"><p>What are the rules for being vegan?</p></div>
	<div id="panel2"><p>A vegan is a type of vegetarian that avoids all animal products. This means that a vegan does not eat meat, milk, dairy products or eggs. Many vegans also will not wear or use products that are made from animals.
	<br>Vegans avoid all animal products such as:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Meat</li>
	<li>Poultry</li>
	<li>Fish</li>
	<li>Seafood</li>
	<li>Eggs</li>
	<li>Dairy</li>
	<li>Honey</li>
	<li>Gelatin</li>
	</ul>

	<div id="flip3"><p>Is a vegan diet healthy for everyone?</p></div>
	<div id="panel3"><p>The key reasons are explained in our, "Why Choose Vegan?" essay. To summarize, they involve:</p>
	Vegetarian and vegan diets can be healthy, but they can lack certain nutrients. 
	You may have to use a little creativity to ensure you get enough protein, calcium, iron, and vitamin B12.
	You can find many of these nutrients in eggs and dairy if you're vegetarian, and from plant sources if you're vegan.</p>

	<div id="flip4"><p>Do you lose weight being vegan?</p></div>
	<div id="panel4"><p>The key reasons are explained in our, "Why Choose Vegan?" essay. To summarize, they involve:
	Potentially. In fact, A 2016 study from Harvard University found vegetarian dieters lost more weight than non-vegetarians after 18 weeks. 
	Vegan dieters actually saw the most weight loss, losing five pounds more than non-vegetarians, while vegetarians lost three pounds more.</p>
	</div>
	<br>

	<div id="flip5"><p>How hard is it really to become vegan?<p></div>
	<div id="panel5"><p>Nearly every single vegan you ask will tell you the transition was much easier than they expected. 
	While becoming vegan may sound difficult right now, you'll no doubt be shocked by how easy this is, especially if you take the time to read up on the topic.</p>
